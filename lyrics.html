    <main>
        <p class="intro">Yeah</p>
        <p class="verse">I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now</p>
        <p class="verse">But hey, what daddy always tell you?</p>
        <p class="verse">Straighten up little soldier</p>
        <p class="verse">Stiffen up that upper lip</p>
        <p class="verse">What you crying about?</p>
        <p class="verse">You got me.</p>

        <p class="verse">Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad</p>
        <p class="verse">When I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had</p>
        <p class="verse">I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh</p>
        <p class="verse">I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry</p>
        <p class="verse">'Cause you're scared, I ain't there?</p>
        <p class="verse">Daddy's with you in your prayers</p>
        <p class="verse">No more crying, wipe them tears</p>
        <p class="verse">Daddy's here, no more nightmares</p>
        <p class="verse">We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it</p>
        <p class="verse">Lainie Uncle's crazy, ain't he?</p>
        <p class="verse">Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it</p>
        <p class="verse">We're all we got in this world</p>
        <p class="verse">When it spins, when it swirls</p>
        <p class="verse">When it whirls, when it twirls</p>
        <p class="verse">Two little beautiful girls</p>
        <p class="verse">Lookin' puzzled, in a daze</p>
        <p class="verse">I know it's confusing you</p>
        <p class="verse">Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news</p>
        <p class="verse">I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems</p>
        <p class="verse">The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me</p>
        <p class="verse">All the things growing up as daddy, that he had to see</p>
        <p class="verse">Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did</p>
        <p class="verse">We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me</p>
        <p class="verse">But things have got so bad between us</p>
        <p class="verse">I don't see us ever being together ever again</p>
        <p class="verse">Like we used to be when we was teenagers</p>
        <p class="verse">But then of course everything always happens for a reason</p>
        <p class="verse">I guess it was never meant to be</p>
        <p class="verse">But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is</p>
        <p class="verse">But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep</p>
        <p class="verse">Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream</p>

        <p class="chorus">Now hush little baby, don't you cry</p>
        <p class="chorus">Everything's gonna be alright</p>
        <p class="chorus">Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya</p>
        <p class="chorus">Daddy's here to hold ya through the night</p>
        <p class="chorus">I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why</p>
        <p class="chorus">We fear how we feel inside</p>
        <p class="chorus">It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby</p>
        <p class="chorus">But I promise mama's gon' be alright</p>

        <p class="verse">(Ha)</p>
        <p class="verse">It's funny</p>
        <p class="verse">I remember back one year when daddy had no money</p>
        <p class="verse">Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up</p>
        <p class="verse">And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me</p>
        <p class="verse">'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em</p>
        <p class="verse">I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying</p>
        <p class="verse">'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job</p>
        <p class="verse">But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom</p>
        <p class="verse">And at the time every house that we lived in</p>
        <p class="verse">Either kept getting broken into and robbed</p>
        <p class="verse">Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar</p>
        <p class="verse">Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college</p>
        <p class="verse">Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it</p>
        <p class="verse">And I know it hurts so bad it broke your momma's heart</p>
        <p class="verse">And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart</p>
        <p class="verse">Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back</p>
        <p class="verse">On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment</p>
        <p class="verse">And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara</p>
        <p class="verse">And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre</p>
        <p class="verse">And flew you and momma out to see me</p>
        <p class="verse">But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me</p>
        <p class="verse">Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it</p>
        <p class="verse">And you and Lainie were too young to understand it</p>
        <p class="verse">Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit</p>
        <p class="verse">And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it</p>
        <p class="verse">I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand</p>
        <p class="verse">'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud</p>
        <p class="verse">Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing</p>
        <p class="verse">Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out</p>
        <p class="verse">To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now</p>
        <p class="verse">Wow, I guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here</p>
        <p class="verse">Lainie I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here</p>
        <p class="verse">I like the sound of that, yeah</p>
        <p class="verse">It's got a ring to it don't it?</p>
        <p class="verse">Shh, mama's only gone for the moment</p>

        <p class="chorus">Now hush little baby, don't you cry</p>
        <p class="chorus">Everything's gonna be alright</p>
        <p class="chorus">Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya</p>
        <p class="chorus">Daddy's here to hold ya through the night</p>
        <p class="chorus">I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why</p>
        <p class="chorus">We fear how we feel inside</p>
        <p class="chorus">It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby</p>
        <p class="chorus">But I promise mama's gon' be alright</p>

        <p class="verse">And if you ask me to</p>
        <p class="verse">Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird</p>
        <p class="verse">I'mma give you the world</p>
        <p class="verse">I'mma buy a diamond ring for you</p>
        <p class="verse">I'll do anything for you to see you smile</p>
        <p class="verse">And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine</p>
        <p class="verse">I'mma break that birdie's neck</p>
        <p class="verse">I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya </p>
        <p class="verse">And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha)</p>
